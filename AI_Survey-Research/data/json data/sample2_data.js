{"0":{"0":{"codebook":{},"current_question":{"data":{"question_text":"In the latest research on Labor Market Exposure to Artificial Intelligence (AI) conducted by the International Monterey Fund (IMF), 'complementarity' is defined as a measure of AI's potential as either a complement or a substitute for labor, where complementarity reflects lower risks of job displacement, and 'exposure' is defined to reflect the potential for AI to be integrated into each occupation based the tasks and skills that characterize each job. Given the high degree of uncertainty over the future of this fast-pacing and broadly applicable technology, the concept of exposure is purposely framed as agnostic on the likelihood of AI complementing or replacing labor in the performance of a given task or occupation.  \nWith respect to occupations, the research indicates that a large share of professional and managerial occupations are almost entirely in the high-exposure categories, corroborating the UK's high aggregate exposure, followed by the US. Nearly 30 percent of workers in the UK are employed in professional occupations, while the corresponding figure for the US stands just above 15 percent. Although the US hosts a larger share of managers, an occupation that exhibits the highest degree of complementarity, the difference between the US (14.4 percent) and UK (10.7 percent) remains relatively small. These occupational groups are also marked by high complementarity.  \nWith respect to gender differences, the research suggests women face a higher labor market exposure to AI compared to men. For instance, in the US, 68 percent of women are in high exposure occupations compared to 51 percent of men. This outcome is primarily attributable to the occupational distribution across genders. Female employment is more concentrated in service and retail occupations, which are relatively more exposed to AI, while men are more likely to be in occupations intensive in manual labor, which are less exposed. Despite women's higher labor market exposure to AI, focusing our attention to the potential for complementarity suggests that women may have a higher likelihood of benefiting from the proliferation of AI. Conversely, although men generally exhibit a larger share of managerial jobs, which have the highest degree of complementarity, the total shares of managers compared to professionals is relatively small. Nevertheless, women are also more susceptible to potential negative impacts from AI adoption, particularly in the UK, US, Brazil, and South Africa. This vulnerability arises from their greater representation in clerical jobs, a category characterized by high exposure and low complementarity, thus at higher risk from AI adoption.  \nWith respect to education level, the research indicates workers with college-level degrees are more exposed to AI in the labor market than those with lower educational attainment. Approximately 90 percent of college-educated workers across most countries are in occupations with high AI labor market exposure, primarily in professional roles. In contrast, those without a high school diploma are predominantly involved in elementary occupations, which results in a significantly reduced AI labor market exposure. In most countries, less than 20 percent of these workers find themselves in high-exposure occupations. The only exception is the the UK, where 40 percent of workers with only a middle school education or less are in high-exposure occupations.  \nWhen considering the potential for complementarity, we observe that in all countries within our sample, workers holding a college degree or higher are predominantly concentrated within occupations that exhibit greater potential to benefit from the widespread adoption of AI. In contrast, among those with an education level of middle school or below, workers in exposed occupations display the lowest prospects of benefiting from AI adoption.  \nFurthermore, the research analysis suggests that the potential adverse impacts of AI might be distributed more evenly than the potential gains. For instance, in the UK, the difference in the proportion of workers in high exposure and low complementarity occupations, conditional on their education level, is less than 10 percentage points \u2014 ranging from 26 percent among workers with middle school education or below to 36 percent among workers with a college education or higher. Conversely, the discrepancy in the potential to benefit from AI is considerably larger. Only 17 percent of workers with middle school education or below find themselves in high-exposure and high-complementarity occupations, as opposed to over 50 percent of workers with a college education or higher.  \nWith respect to age, the research does not observe a straightforward association between age and AI exposure. Overall, age patterns are likely very intertwined with country-specific long-term trends in educational attainment and female labor force participation, which can substantially blur the underlying life-cycle profiles. One general observation is that the youngest workers tend to have lower AI labor market exposure than prime-age workers. Moreover, conditional on being in high-exposure occupations, younger workers are also less likely to be in jobs with high complementarity, and thus are more susceptible to potential negative impacts stemming from widespread AI adoption in labor markets.  \nWith respect to earnings, the research indicates a positive association between earnings and share of employment (affected by AI adoption in labor markets) in high-exposure occupations emerges in all countries. Our analysis reveals a more equal distribution of workers with high AI labor market exposure and low complementarity across the income distribution, indicating that the risks from widespread AI adoption in labor markets may be broadly evenly distributed across the earnings distribution. In contrast, upon assessing which workers stand to benefit most, in all countries in the sample, employment in high-complementarity occupations is concentrated in the top deciles of the earnings distribution.On a scale of 0-10, how concerned are you about the safety of the AI products you currently use or have used in the past?

For instance, in the UK, the difference in the proportion of workers in high exposure and low complementarity occupations, conditional on their education level, is less than 10 percentage points \u2014 ranging from 26 percent among workers with middle school education or below to 36 percent among workers with a college education or higher. Conversely, the discrepancy in the potential to benefit from AI is considerably larger. Only 17 percent of workers with middle school education or below find themselves in high-exposure and high-complementarity occupations, as opposed to over 50 percent of workers with a college education or higher.  \nWith respect to age, the research does not observe a straightforward association between age and AI exposure. Overall, age patterns are likely very intertwined with country-specific long-term trends in educational attainment and female labor force participation, which can substantially blur the underlying life-cycle profiles. One general observation is that the youngest workers tend to have lower AI labor market exposure than prime-age workers. Moreover, conditional on being in high-exposure occupations, younger workers are also less likely to be in jobs with high complementarity, and thus are more susceptible to potential negative impacts stemming from widespread AI adoption in labor markets.  \nWith respect to earnings, the research indicates a positive association between earnings and share of employment (affected by AI adoption in labor markets) in high-exposure occupations emerges in all countries. Our analysis reveals a more equal distribution of workers with high AI labor market exposure and low complementarity across the income distribution, indicating that the risks from widespread AI adoption in labor markets may be broadly evenly distributed across the earnings distribution. In contrast, upon assessing which workers stand to benefit most, in all countries in the sample, employment in high-complementarity occupations is concentrated in the top deciles of the earnings distribution.On a scale of 0-10, how concerned are you about the safety of the AI products you currently use or have used in the past?

Given the high degree of uncertainty over the future of this fast-pacing and broadly applicable technology, the concept of exposure is purposely framed as agnostic on the likelihood of AI complementing or replacing labor in the performance of a given task or occupation.  \nWith respect to occupations, the research indicates that a large share of professional and managerial occupations are almost entirely in the high-exposure categories, corroborating the UK's high aggregate exposure, followed by the US. Nearly 30 percent of workers in the UK are employed in professional occupations, while the corresponding figure for the US stands just above 15 percent. Although the US hosts a larger share of managers, an occupation that exhibits the highest degree of complementarity, the difference between the US (14.4 percent) and UK (10.7 percent) remains relatively small. These occupational groups are also marked by high complementarity.  \nWith respect to gender differences, the research suggests women face a higher labor market exposure to AI compared to men. For instance, in the US, 68 percent of women are in high exposure occupations compared to 51 percent of men. This outcome is primarily attributable to the occupational distribution across genders. Female employment is more concentrated in service and retail occupations, which are relatively more exposed to AI, while men are more likely to be in occupations intensive in manual labor, which are less exposed. Despite women's higher labor market exposure to AI, focusing our attention to the potential for complementarity suggests that women may have a higher likelihood of benefiting from the proliferation of AI. Conversely, although men generally exhibit a larger share of managerial jobs, which have the highest degree of complementarity, the total shares of managers compared to professionals is relatively small. Nevertheless, women are also more susceptible to potential negative impacts from AI adoption, particularly in the UK, US, Brazil, and South Africa. This vulnerability arises from their greater representation in clerical jobs, a category characterized by high exposure and low complementarity, thus at higher risk from AI adoption.  \nWith respect to education level, the research indicates workers with college-level degrees are more exposed to AI in the labor market than those with lower educational attainment. Approximately 90 percent of college-educated workers across most countries are in occupations with high AI labor market exposure, primarily in professional roles. In contrast, those without a high school diploma are predominantly involved in elementary occupations, which results in a significantly reduced AI labor market exposure. In most countries, less than 20 percent of these workers find themselves in high-exposure occupations.

Moreover, conditional on being in high-exposure occupations, younger workers are also less likely to be in jobs with high complementarity, and thus are more susceptible to potential negative impacts stemming from widespread AI adoption in labor markets.  \nWith respect to earnings, the research indicates a positive association between earnings and share of employment (affected by AI adoption in labor markets) in high-exposure occupations emerges in all countries. Our analysis reveals a more equal distribution of workers with high AI labor market exposure and low complementarity across the income distribution, indicating that the risks from widespread AI adoption in labor markets may be broadly evenly distributed across the earnings distribution. In contrast, upon assessing which workers stand to benefit most, in all countries in the sample, employment in high-complementarity occupations is concentrated in the top deciles of the earnings distribution.On a scale of 0-10, how concerned are you about the safety of the AI products you currently use or have used in the past?

Given the high degree of uncertainty over the future of this fast-pacing and broadly applicable technology, the concept of exposure is purposely framed as agnostic on the likelihood of AI complementing or replacing labor in the performance of a given task or occupation.  \nWith respect to occupations, the research indicates that a large share of professional and managerial occupations are almost entirely in the high-exposure categories, corroborating the UK's high aggregate exposure, followed by the US. Nearly 30 percent of workers in the UK are employed in professional occupations, while the corresponding figure for the US stands just above 15 percent. Although the US hosts a larger share of managers, an occupation that exhibits the highest degree of complementarity, the difference between the US (14.4 percent) and UK (10.7 percent) remains relatively small. These occupational groups are also marked by high complementarity.  \nWith respect to gender differences, the research suggests women face a higher labor market exposure to AI compared to men. For instance, in the US, 68 percent of women are in high exposure occupations compared to 51 percent of men. This outcome is primarily attributable to the occupational distribution across genders. Female employment is more concentrated in service and retail occupations, which are relatively more exposed to AI, while men are more likely to be in occupations intensive in manual labor, which are less exposed. Despite women's higher labor market exposure to AI, focusing our attention to the potential for complementarity suggests that women may have a higher likelihood of benefiting from the proliferation of AI. Conversely, although men generally exhibit a larger share of managerial jobs, which have the highest degree of complementarity, the total shares of managers compared to professionals is relatively small. Nevertheless, women are also more susceptible to potential negative impacts from AI adoption, particularly in the UK, US, Brazil, and South Africa. This vulnerability arises from their greater representation in clerical jobs, a category characterized by high exposure and low complementarity, thus at higher risk from AI adoption.  \nWith respect to education level, the research indicates workers with college-level degrees are more exposed to AI in the labor market than those with lower educational attainment. Approximately 90 percent of college-educated workers across most countries are in occupations with high AI labor market exposure, primarily in professional roles. In contrast, those without a high school diploma are predominantly involved in elementary occupations, which results in a significantly reduced AI labor market exposure. In most countries, less than 20 percent of these workers find themselves in high-exposure occupations. The only exception is the the UK, where 40 percent of workers with only a middle school education or less are in high-exposure occupations.  \nWhen considering the potential for complementarity, we observe that in all countries within our sample, workers holding a college degree or higher are predominantly concentrated within occupations that exhibit greater potential to benefit from the widespread adoption of AI. In contrast, among those with an education level of middle school or below, workers in exposed occupations display the lowest prospects of benefiting from AI adoption.  \nFurthermore, the research analysis suggests that the potential adverse impacts of AI might be distributed more evenly than the potential gains. For instance, in the UK, the difference in the proportion of workers in high exposure and low complementarity occupations, conditional on their education level, is less than 10 percentage points \u2014 ranging from 26 percent among workers with middle school education or below to 36 percent among workers with a college education or higher. Conversely, the discrepancy in the potential to benefit from AI is considerably larger. Only 17 percent of workers with middle school education or below find themselves in high-exposure and high-complementarity occupations, as opposed to over 50 percent of workers with a college education or higher.  \nWith respect to age, the research does not observe a straightforward association between age and AI exposure. Overall, age patterns are likely very intertwined with country-specific long-term trends in educational attainment and female labor force participation, which can substantially blur the underlying life-cycle profiles. One general observation is that the youngest workers tend to have lower AI labor market exposure than prime-age workers.

Given the high degree of uncertainty over the future of this fast-pacing and broadly applicable technology, the concept of exposure is purposely framed as agnostic on the likelihood of AI complementing or replacing labor in the performance of a given task or occupation.  \nWith respect to occupations, the research indicates that a large share of professional and managerial occupations are almost entirely in the high-exposure categories, corroborating the UK's high aggregate exposure, followed by the US. Nearly 30 percent of workers in the UK are employed in professional occupations, while the corresponding figure for the US stands just above 15 percent. Although the US hosts a larger share of managers, an occupation that exhibits the highest degree of complementarity, the difference between the US (14.4 percent) and UK (10.7 percent) remains relatively small. These occupational groups are also marked by high complementarity.  \nWith respect to gender differences, the research suggests women face a higher labor market exposure to AI compared to men. For instance, in the US, 68 percent of women are in high exposure occupations compared to 51 percent of men. This outcome is primarily attributable to the occupational distribution across genders. Female employment is more concentrated in service and retail occupations, which are relatively more exposed to AI, while men are more likely to be in occupations intensive in manual labor, which are less exposed. Despite women's higher labor market exposure to AI, focusing our attention to the potential for complementarity suggests that women may have a higher likelihood of benefiting from the proliferation of AI. Conversely, although men generally exhibit a larger share of managerial jobs, which have the highest degree of complementarity, the total shares of managers compared to professionals is relatively small. Nevertheless, women are also more susceptible to potential negative impacts from AI adoption, particularly in the UK, US, Brazil, and South Africa. This vulnerability arises from their greater representation in clerical jobs, a category characterized by high exposure and low complementarity, thus at higher risk from AI adoption.  \nWith respect to education level, the research indicates workers with college-level degrees are more exposed to AI in the labor market than those with lower educational attainment. Approximately 90 percent of college-educated workers across most countries are in occupations with high AI labor market exposure, primarily in professional roles. In contrast, those without a high school diploma are predominantly involved in elementary occupations, which results in a significantly reduced AI labor market exposure. In most countries, less than 20 percent of these workers find themselves in high-exposure occupations. The only exception is the the UK, where 40 percent of workers with only a middle school education or less are in high-exposure occupations.  \nWhen considering the potential for complementarity, we observe that in all countries within our sample, workers holding a college degree or higher are predominantly concentrated within occupations that exhibit greater potential to benefit from the widespread adoption of AI. In contrast, among those with an education level of middle school or below, workers in exposed occupations display the lowest prospects of benefiting from AI adoption.  \nFurthermore, the research analysis suggests that the potential adverse impacts of AI might be distributed more evenly than the potential gains. For instance, in the UK, the difference in the proportion of workers in high exposure and low complementarity occupations, conditional on their education level, is less than 10 percentage points \u2014 ranging from 26 percent among workers with middle school education or below to 36 percent among workers with a college education or higher. Conversely, the discrepancy in the potential to benefit from AI is considerably larger. Only 17 percent of workers with middle school education or below find themselves in high-exposure and high-complementarity occupations, as opposed to over 50 percent of workers with a college education or higher.  \nWith respect to age, the research does not observe a straightforward association between age and AI exposure. Overall, age patterns are likely very intertwined with country-specific long-term trends in educational attainment and female labor force participation, which can substantially blur the underlying life-cycle profiles. One general observation is that the youngest workers tend to have lower AI labor market exposure than prime-age workers. Moreover, conditional on being in high-exposure occupations, younger workers are also less likely to be in jobs with high complementarity, and thus are more susceptible to potential negative impacts stemming from widespread AI adoption in labor markets.  \nWith respect to earnings, the research indicates a positive association between earnings and share of employment (affected by AI adoption in labor markets) in high-exposure occupations emerges in all countries. Our analysis reveals a more equal distribution of workers with high AI labor market exposure and low complementarity across the income distribution, indicating that the risks from widespread AI adoption in labor markets may be broadly evenly distributed across the earnings distribution. In contrast, upon assessing which workers stand to benefit most, in all countries in the sample, employment in high-complementarity occupations is concentrated in the top deciles of the earnings distribution.On a scale of 0-10, how concerned are you about the safety of the AI products you currently use or have used in the past?

In contrast, those without a high school diploma are predominantly involved in elementary occupations, which results in a significantly reduced AI labor market exposure. In most countries, less than 20 percent of these workers find themselves in high-exposure occupations. The only exception is the the UK, where 40 percent of workers with only a middle school education or less are in high-exposure occupations.  \nWhen considering the potential for complementarity, we observe that in all countries within our sample, workers holding a college degree or higher are predominantly concentrated within occupations that exhibit greater potential to benefit from the widespread adoption of AI. In contrast, among those with an education level of middle school or below, workers in exposed occupations display the lowest prospects of benefiting from AI adoption.  \nFurthermore, the research analysis suggests that the potential adverse impacts of AI might be distributed more evenly than the potential gains. For instance, in the UK, the difference in the proportion of workers in high exposure and low complementarity occupations, conditional on their education level, is less than 10 percentage points \u2014 ranging from 26 percent among workers with middle school education or below to 36 percent among workers with a college education or higher. Conversely, the discrepancy in the potential to benefit from AI is considerably larger. Only 17 percent of workers with middle school education or below find themselves in high-exposure and high-complementarity occupations, as opposed to over 50 percent of workers with a college education or higher.  \nWith respect to age, the research does not observe a straightforward association between age and AI exposure. Overall, age patterns are likely very intertwined with country-specific long-term trends in educational attainment and female labor force participation, which can substantially blur the underlying life-cycle profiles. One general observation is that the youngest workers tend to have lower AI labor market exposure than prime-age workers. Moreover, conditional on being in high-exposure occupations, younger workers are also less likely to be in jobs with high complementarity, and thus are more susceptible to potential negative impacts stemming from widespread AI adoption in labor markets.  \nWith respect to earnings, the research indicates a positive association between earnings and share of employment (affected by AI adoption in labor markets) in high-exposure occupations emerges in all countries. Our analysis reveals a more equal distribution of workers with high AI labor market exposure and low complementarity across the income distribution, indicating that the risks from widespread AI adoption in labor markets may be broadly evenly distributed across the earnings distribution. In contrast, upon assessing which workers stand to benefit most, in all countries in the sample, employment in high-complementarity occupations is concentrated in the top deciles of the earnings distribution.On a scale of 0-10, how concerned are you about the safety of the AI products you currently use or have used in the past?

Given the high degree of uncertainty over the future of this fast-pacing and broadly applicable technology, the concept of exposure is purposely framed as agnostic on the likelihood of AI complementing or replacing labor in the performance of a given task or occupation.  \nWith respect to occupations, the research indicates that a large share of professional and managerial occupations are almost entirely in the high-exposure categories, corroborating the UK's high aggregate exposure, followed by the US. Nearly 30 percent of workers in the UK are employed in professional occupations, while the corresponding figure for the US stands just above 15 percent. Although the US hosts a larger share of managers, an occupation that exhibits the highest degree of complementarity, the difference between the US (14.4 percent) and UK (10.7 percent) remains relatively small.

Female employment is more concentrated in service and retail occupations, which are relatively more exposed to AI, while men are more likely to be in occupations intensive in manual labor, which are less exposed.

Conversely, the discrepancy in the potential to benefit from AI is considerably larger. Only 17 percent of workers with middle school education or below find themselves in high-exposure and high-complementarity occupations, as opposed to over 50 percent of workers with a college education or higher.  \nWith respect to age, the research does not observe a straightforward association between age and AI exposure. Overall, age patterns are likely very intertwined with country-specific long-term trends in educational attainment and female labor force participation, which can substantially blur the underlying life-cycle profiles. One general observation is that the youngest workers tend to have lower AI labor market exposure than prime-age workers. Moreover, conditional on being in high-exposure occupations, younger workers are also less likely to be in jobs with high complementarity, and thus are more susceptible to potential negative impacts stemming from widespread AI adoption in labor markets.  \nWith respect to earnings, the research indicates a positive association between earnings and share of employment (affected by AI adoption in labor markets) in high-exposure occupations emerges in all countries. Our analysis reveals a more equal distribution of workers with high AI labor market exposure and low complementarity across the income distribution, indicating that the risks from widespread AI adoption in labor markets may be broadly evenly distributed across the earnings distribution. In contrast, upon assessing which workers stand to benefit most, in all countries in the sample, employment in high-complementarity occupations is concentrated in the top deciles of the earnings distribution.On a scale of 0-10, how concerned are you about the safety of the AI products you currently use or have used in the past?

Given the high degree of uncertainty over the future of this fast-pacing and broadly applicable technology, the concept of exposure is purposely framed as agnostic on the likelihood of AI complementing or replacing labor in the performance of a given task or occupation.  \nWith respect to occupations, the research indicates that a large share of professional and managerial occupations are almost entirely in the high-exposure categories, corroborating the UK's high aggregate exposure, followed by the US. Nearly 30 percent of workers in the UK are employed in professional occupations, while the corresponding figure for the US stands just above 15 percent. Although the US hosts a larger share of managers, an occupation that exhibits the highest degree of complementarity, the difference between the US (14.4 percent) and UK (10.7 percent) remains relatively small. These occupational groups are also marked by high complementarity.  \nWith respect to gender differences, the research suggests women face a higher labor market exposure to AI compared to men. For instance, in the US, 68 percent of women are in high exposure occupations compared to 51 percent of men. This outcome is primarily attributable to the occupational distribution across genders. Female employment is more concentrated in service and retail occupations, which are relatively more exposed to AI, while men are more likely to be in occupations intensive in manual labor, which are less exposed. Despite women's higher labor market exposure to AI, focusing our attention to the potential for complementarity suggests that women may have a higher likelihood of benefiting from the proliferation of AI. Conversely, although men generally exhibit a larger share of managerial jobs, which have the highest degree of complementarity, the total shares of managers compared to professionals is relatively small. Nevertheless, women are also more susceptible to potential negative impacts from AI adoption, particularly in the UK, US, Brazil, and South Africa. This vulnerability arises from their greater representation in clerical jobs, a category characterized by high exposure and low complementarity, thus at higher risk from AI adoption.  \nWith respect to education level, the research indicates workers with college-level degrees are more exposed to AI in the labor market than those with lower educational attainment. Approximately 90 percent of college-educated workers across most countries are in occupations with high AI labor market exposure, primarily in professional roles. In contrast, those without a high school diploma are predominantly involved in elementary occupations, which results in a significantly reduced AI labor market exposure. In most countries, less than 20 percent of these workers find themselves in high-exposure occupations. The only exception is the the UK, where 40 percent of workers with only a middle school education or less are in high-exposure occupations.  \nWhen considering the potential for complementarity, we observe that in all countries within our sample, workers holding a college degree or higher are predominantly concentrated within occupations that exhibit greater potential to benefit from the widespread adoption of AI.

Given the high degree of uncertainty over the future of this fast-pacing and broadly applicable technology, the concept of exposure is purposely framed as agnostic on the likelihood of AI complementing or replacing labor in the performance of a given task or occupation.  \nWith respect to occupations, the research indicates that a large share of professional and managerial occupations are almost entirely in the high-exposure categories, corroborating the UK's high aggregate exposure, followed by the US. Nearly 30 percent of workers in the UK are employed in professional occupations, while the corresponding figure for the US stands just above 15 percent. Although the US hosts a larger share of managers, an occupation that exhibits the highest degree of complementarity, the difference between the US (14.4 percent) and UK (10.7 percent) remains relatively small. These occupational groups are also marked by high complementarity.  \nWith respect to gender differences, the research suggests women face a higher labor market exposure to AI compared to men. For instance, in the US, 68 percent of women are in high exposure occupations compared to 51 percent of men. This outcome is primarily attributable to the occupational distribution across genders. Female employment is more concentrated in service and retail occupations, which are relatively more exposed to AI, while men are more likely to be in occupations intensive in manual labor, which are less exposed. Despite women's higher labor market exposure to AI, focusing our attention to the potential for complementarity suggests that women may have a higher likelihood of benefiting from the proliferation of AI. Conversely, although men generally exhibit a larger share of managerial jobs, which have the highest degree of complementarity, the total shares of managers compared to professionals is relatively small. Nevertheless, women are also more susceptible to potential negative impacts from AI adoption, particularly in the UK, US, Brazil, and South Africa. This vulnerability arises from their greater representation in clerical jobs, a category characterized by high exposure and low complementarity, thus at higher risk from AI adoption.  \nWith respect to education level, the research indicates workers with college-level degrees are more exposed to AI in the labor market than those with lower educational attainment. Approximately 90 percent of college-educated workers across most countries are in occupations with high AI labor market exposure, primarily in professional roles. In contrast, those without a high school diploma are predominantly involved in elementary occupations, which results in a significantly reduced AI labor market exposure. In most countries, less than 20 percent of these workers find themselves in high-exposure occupations. The only exception is the the UK, where 40 percent of workers with only a middle school education or less are in high-exposure occupations.  \nWhen considering the potential for complementarity, we observe that in all countries within our sample, workers holding a college degree or higher are predominantly concentrated within occupations that exhibit greater potential to benefit from the widespread adoption of AI. In contrast, among those with an education level of middle school or below, workers in exposed occupations display the lowest prospects of benefiting from AI adoption.  \nFurthermore, the research analysis suggests that the potential adverse impacts of AI might be distributed more evenly than the potential gains. For instance, in the UK, the difference in the proportion of workers in high exposure and low complementarity occupations, conditional on their education level, is less than 10 percentage points \u2014 ranging from 26 percent among workers with middle school education or below to 36 percent among workers with a college education or higher. Conversely, the discrepancy in the potential to benefit from AI is considerably larger. Only 17 percent of workers with middle school education or below find themselves in high-exposure and high-complementarity occupations, as opposed to over 50 percent of workers with a college education or higher.  \nWith respect to age, the research does not observe a straightforward association between age and AI exposure. Overall, age patterns are likely very intertwined with country-specific long-term trends in educational attainment and female labor force participation, which can substantially blur the underlying life-cycle profiles. One general observation is that the youngest workers tend to have lower AI labor market exposure than prime-age workers. Moreover, conditional on being in high-exposure occupations, younger workers are also less likely to be in jobs with high complementarity, and thus are more susceptible to potential negative impacts stemming from widespread AI adoption in labor markets.  \nWith respect to earnings, the research indicates a positive association between earnings and share of employment (affected by AI adoption in labor markets) in high-exposure occupations emerges in all countries. Our analysis reveals a more equal distribution of workers with high AI labor market exposure and low complementarity across the income distribution, indicating that the risks from widespread AI adoption in labor markets may be broadly evenly distributed across the earnings distribution. In contrast, upon assessing which workers stand to benefit most, in all countries in the sample, employment in high-complementarity occupations is concentrated in the top deciles of the earnings distribution.On a scale of 0-10, how concerned are you about the safety of the AI products you currently use or have used in the past?

Female employment is more concentrated in service and retail occupations, which are relatively more exposed to AI, while men are more likely to be in occupations intensive in manual labor, which are less exposed. Despite women's higher labor market exposure to AI, focusing our attention to the potential for complementarity suggests that women may have a higher likelihood of benefiting from the proliferation of AI. Conversely, although men generally exhibit a larger share of managerial jobs, which have the highest degree of complementarity, the total shares of managers compared to professionals is relatively small. Nevertheless, women are also more susceptible to potential negative impacts from AI adoption, particularly in the UK, US, Brazil, and South Africa. This vulnerability arises from their greater representation in clerical jobs, a category characterized by high exposure and low complementarity, thus at higher risk from AI adoption.  \nWith respect to education level, the research indicates workers with college-level degrees are more exposed to AI in the labor market than those with lower educational attainment. Approximately 90 percent of college-educated workers across most countries are in occupations with high AI labor market exposure, primarily in professional roles. In contrast, those without a high school diploma are predominantly involved in elementary occupations, which results in a significantly reduced AI labor market exposure. In most countries, less than 20 percent of these workers find themselves in high-exposure occupations. The only exception is the the UK, where 40 percent of workers with only a middle school education or less are in high-exposure occupations.  \nWhen considering the potential for complementarity, we observe that in all countries within our sample, workers holding a college degree or higher are predominantly concentrated within occupations that exhibit greater potential to benefit from the widespread adoption of AI. In contrast, among those with an education level of middle school or below, workers in exposed occupations display the lowest prospects of benefiting from AI adoption.  \nFurthermore, the research analysis suggests that the potential adverse impacts of AI might be distributed more evenly than the potential gains. For instance, in the UK, the difference in the proportion of workers in high exposure and low complementarity occupations, conditional on their education level, is less than 10 percentage points \u2014 ranging from 26 percent among workers with middle school education or below to 36 percent among workers with a college education or higher. Conversely, the discrepancy in the potential to benefit from AI is considerably larger. Only 17 percent of workers with middle school education or below find themselves in high-exposure and high-complementarity occupations, as opposed to over 50 percent of workers with a college education or higher.  \nWith respect to age, the research does not observe a straightforward association between age and AI exposure. Overall, age patterns are likely very intertwined with country-specific long-term trends in educational attainment and female labor force participation, which can substantially blur the underlying life-cycle profiles. One general observation is that the youngest workers tend to have lower AI labor market exposure than prime-age workers. Moreover, conditional on being in high-exposure occupations, younger workers are also less likely to be in jobs with high complementarity, and thus are more susceptible to potential negative impacts stemming from widespread AI adoption in labor markets.  \nWith respect to earnings, the research indicates a positive association between earnings and share of employment (affected by AI adoption in labor markets) in high-exposure occupations emerges in all countries. Our analysis reveals a more equal distribution of workers with high AI labor market exposure and low complementarity across the income distribution, indicating that the risks from widespread AI adoption in labor markets may be broadly evenly distributed across the earnings distribution. In contrast, upon assessing which workers stand to benefit most, in all countries in the sample, employment in high-complementarity occupations is concentrated in the top deciles of the earnings distribution.On a scale of 0-10, how concerned are you about the safety of the AI products you currently use or have used in the past?

In most countries, less than 20 percent of these workers find themselves in high-exposure occupations. The only exception is the the UK, where 40 percent of workers with only a middle school education or less are in high-exposure occupations.  \nWhen considering the potential for complementarity, we observe that in all countries within our sample, workers holding a college degree or higher are predominantly concentrated within occupations that exhibit greater potential to benefit from the widespread adoption of AI. In contrast, among those with an education level of middle school or below, workers in exposed occupations display the lowest prospects of benefiting from AI adoption.  \nFurthermore, the research analysis suggests that the potential adverse impacts of AI might be distributed more evenly than the potential gains. For instance, in the UK, the difference in the proportion of workers in high exposure and low complementarity occupations, conditional on their education level, is less than 10 percentage points \u2014 ranging from 26 percent among workers with middle school education or below to 36 percent among workers with a college education or higher. Conversely, the discrepancy in the potential to benefit from AI is considerably larger. Only 17 percent of workers with middle school education or below find themselves in high-exposure and high-complementarity occupations, as opposed to over 50 percent of workers with a college education or higher.  \nWith respect to age, the research does not observe a straightforward association between age and AI exposure. Overall, age patterns are likely very intertwined with country-specific long-term trends in educational attainment and female labor force participation, which can substantially blur the underlying life-cycle profiles. One general observation is that the youngest workers tend to have lower AI labor market exposure than prime-age workers. Moreover, conditional on being in high-exposure occupations, younger workers are also less likely to be in jobs with high complementarity, and thus are more susceptible to potential negative impacts stemming from widespread AI adoption in labor markets.  \nWith respect to earnings, the research indicates a positive association between earnings and share of employment (affected by AI adoption in labor markets) in high-exposure occupations emerges in all countries. Our analysis reveals a more equal distribution of workers with high AI labor market exposure and low complementarity across the income distribution, indicating that the risks from widespread AI adoption in labor markets may be broadly evenly distributed across the earnings distribution. In contrast, upon assessing which workers stand to benefit most, in all countries in the sample, employment in high-complementarity occupations is concentrated in the top deciles of the earnings distribution.On a scale of 0-10, how concerned are you about the safety of the AI products you currently use or have used in the past?

Given the high degree of uncertainty over the future of this fast-pacing and broadly applicable technology, the concept of exposure is purposely framed as agnostic on the likelihood of AI complementing or replacing labor in the performance of a given task or occupation.  \nWith respect to occupations, the research indicates that a large share of professional and managerial occupations are almost entirely in the high-exposure categories, corroborating the UK's high aggregate exposure, followed by the US. Nearly 30 percent of workers in the UK are employed in professional occupations, while the corresponding figure for the US stands just above 15 percent. Although the US hosts a larger share of managers, an occupation that exhibits the highest degree of complementarity, the difference between the US (14.4 percent) and UK (10.7 percent) remains relatively small.

For instance, in the US, 68 percent of women are in high exposure occupations compared to 51 percent of men. This outcome is primarily attributable to the occupational distribution across genders. Female employment is more concentrated in service and retail occupations, which are relatively more exposed to AI, while men are more likely to be in occupations intensive in manual labor, which are less exposed.

Given the high degree of uncertainty over the future of this fast-pacing and broadly applicable technology, the concept of exposure is purposely framed as agnostic on the likelihood of AI complementing or replacing labor in the performance of a given task or occupation.  \nWith respect to occupations, the research indicates that a large share of professional and managerial occupations are almost entirely in the high-exposure categories, corroborating the UK's high aggregate exposure, followed by the US. Nearly 30 percent of workers in the UK are employed in professional occupations, while the corresponding figure for the US stands just above 15 percent. Although the US hosts a larger share of managers, an occupation that exhibits the highest degree of complementarity, the difference between the US (14.4 percent) and UK (10.7 percent) remains relatively small. These occupational groups are also marked by high complementarity.  \nWith respect to gender differences, the research suggests women face a higher labor market exposure to AI compared to men. For instance, in the US, 68 percent of women are in high exposure occupations compared to 51 percent of men. This outcome is primarily attributable to the occupational distribution across genders. Female employment is more concentrated in service and retail occupations, which are relatively more exposed to AI, while men are more likely to be in occupations intensive in manual labor, which are less exposed. Despite women's higher labor market exposure to AI, focusing our attention to the potential for complementarity suggests that women may have a higher likelihood of benefiting from the proliferation of AI. Conversely, although men generally exhibit a larger share of managerial jobs, which have the highest degree of complementarity, the total shares of managers compared to professionals is relatively small. Nevertheless, women are also more susceptible to potential negative impacts from AI adoption, particularly in the UK, US, Brazil, and South Africa. This vulnerability arises from their greater representation in clerical jobs, a category characterized by high exposure and low complementarity, thus at higher risk from AI adoption.  \nWith respect to education level, the research indicates workers with college-level degrees are more exposed to AI in the labor market than those with lower educational attainment. Approximately 90 percent of college-educated workers across most countries are in occupations with high AI labor market exposure, primarily in professional roles. In contrast, those without a high school diploma are predominantly involved in elementary occupations, which results in a significantly reduced AI labor market exposure. In most countries, less than 20 percent of these workers find themselves in high-exposure occupations. The only exception is the the UK, where 40 percent of workers with only a middle school education or less are in high-exposure occupations.  \nWhen considering the potential for complementarity, we observe that in all countries within our sample, workers holding a college degree or higher are predominantly concentrated within occupations that exhibit greater potential to benefit from the widespread adoption of AI. In contrast, among those with an education level of middle school or below, workers in exposed occupations display the lowest prospects of benefiting from AI adoption.  \nFurthermore, the research analysis suggests that the potential adverse impacts of AI might be distributed more evenly than the potential gains. For instance, in the UK, the difference in the proportion of workers in high exposure and low complementarity occupations, conditional on their education level, is less than 10 percentage points \u2014 ranging from 26 percent among workers with middle school education or below to 36 percent among workers with a college education or higher. Conversely, the discrepancy in the potential to benefit from AI is considerably larger. Only 17 percent of workers with middle school education or below find themselves in high-exposure and high-complementarity occupations, as opposed to over 50 percent of workers with a college education or higher.  \nWith respect to age, the research does not observe a straightforward association between age and AI exposure. Overall, age patterns are likely very intertwined with country-specific long-term trends in educational attainment and female labor force participation, which can substantially blur the underlying life-cycle profiles. One general observation is that the youngest workers tend to have lower AI labor market exposure than prime-age workers. Moreover, conditional on being in high-exposure occupations, younger workers are also less likely to be in jobs with high complementarity, and thus are more susceptible to potential negative impacts stemming from widespread AI adoption in labor markets.  \nWith respect to earnings, the research indicates a positive association between earnings and share of employment (affected by AI adoption in labor markets) in high-exposure occupations emerges in all countries. Our analysis reveals a more equal distribution of workers with high AI labor market exposure and low complementarity across the income distribution, indicating that the risks from widespread AI adoption in labor markets may be broadly evenly distributed across the earnings distribution. In contrast, upon assessing which workers stand to benefit most, in all countries in the sample, employment in high-complementarity occupations is concentrated in the top deciles of the earnings distribution.On a scale of 0-10, how concerned are you about the safety of the AI products you currently use or have used in the past?

These occupational groups are also marked by high complementarity.  \nWith respect to gender differences, the research suggests women face a higher labor market exposure to AI compared to men. For instance, in the US, 68 percent of women are in high exposure occupations compared to 51 percent of men. This outcome is primarily attributable to the occupational distribution across genders. Female employment is more concentrated in service and retail occupations, which are relatively more exposed to AI, while men are more likely to be in occupations intensive in manual labor, which are less exposed. Despite women's higher labor market exposure to AI, focusing our attention to the potential for complementarity suggests that women may have a higher likelihood of benefiting from the proliferation of AI. Conversely, although men generally exhibit a larger share of managerial jobs, which have the highest degree of complementarity, the total shares of managers compared to professionals is relatively small. Nevertheless, women are also more susceptible to potential negative impacts from AI adoption, particularly in the UK, US, Brazil, and South Africa. This vulnerability arises from their greater representation in clerical jobs, a category characterized by high exposure and low complementarity, thus at higher risk from AI adoption.  \nWith respect to education level, the research indicates workers with college-level degrees are more exposed to AI in the labor market than those with lower educational attainment. Approximately 90 percent of college-educated workers across most countries are in occupations with high AI labor market exposure, primarily in professional roles. In contrast, those without a high school diploma are predominantly involved in elementary occupations, which results in a significantly reduced AI labor market exposure. In most countries, less than 20 percent of these workers find themselves in high-exposure occupations. The only exception is the the UK, where 40 percent of workers with only a middle school education or less are in high-exposure occupations.  \nWhen considering the potential for complementarity, we observe that in all countries within our sample, workers holding a college degree or higher are predominantly concentrated within occupations that exhibit greater potential to benefit from the widespread adoption of AI. In contrast, among those with an education level of middle school or below, workers in exposed occupations display the lowest prospects of benefiting from AI adoption.  \nFurthermore, the research analysis suggests that the potential adverse impacts of AI might be distributed more evenly than the potential gains. For instance, in the UK, the difference in the proportion of workers in high exposure and low complementarity occupations, conditional on their education level, is less than 10 percentage points \u2014 ranging from 26 percent among workers with middle school education or below to 36 percent among workers with a college education or higher. Conversely, the discrepancy in the potential to benefit from AI is considerably larger. Only 17 percent of workers with middle school education or below find themselves in high-exposure and high-complementarity occupations, as opposed to over 50 percent of workers with a college education or higher.  \nWith respect to age, the research does not observe a straightforward association between age and AI exposure. Overall, age patterns are likely very intertwined with country-specific long-term trends in educational attainment and female labor force participation, which can substantially blur the underlying life-cycle profiles. One general observation is that the youngest workers tend to have lower AI labor market exposure than prime-age workers. Moreover, conditional on being in high-exposure occupations, younger workers are also less likely to be in jobs with high complementarity, and thus are more susceptible to potential negative impacts stemming from widespread AI adoption in labor markets.  \nWith respect to earnings, the research indicates a positive association between earnings and share of employment (affected by AI adoption in labor markets) in high-exposure occupations emerges in all countries. Our analysis reveals a more equal distribution of workers with high AI labor market exposure and low complementarity across the income distribution, indicating that the risks from widespread AI adoption in labor markets may be broadly evenly distributed across the earnings distribution. In contrast, upon assessing which workers stand to benefit most, in all countries in the sample, employment in high-complementarity occupations is concentrated in the top deciles of the earnings distribution.On a scale of 0-10, how concerned are you about the safety of the AI products you currently use or have used in the past?

This vulnerability arises from their greater representation in clerical jobs, a category characterized by high exposure and low complementarity, thus at higher risk from AI adoption.  \nWith respect to education level, the research indicates workers with college-level degrees are more exposed to AI in the labor market than those with lower educational attainment. Approximately 90 percent of college-educated workers across most countries are in occupations with high AI labor market exposure, primarily in professional roles. In contrast, those without a high school diploma are predominantly involved in elementary occupations, which results in a significantly reduced AI labor market exposure. In most countries, less than 20 percent of these workers find themselves in high-exposure occupations. The only exception is the the UK, where 40 percent of workers with only a middle school education or less are in high-exposure occupations.  \nWhen considering the potential for complementarity, we observe that in all countries within our sample, workers holding a college degree or higher are predominantly concentrated within occupations that exhibit greater potential to benefit from the widespread adoption of AI. In contrast, among those with an education level of middle school or below, workers in exposed occupations display the lowest prospects of benefiting from AI adoption.  \nFurthermore, the research analysis suggests that the potential adverse impacts of AI might be distributed more evenly than the potential gains. For instance, in the UK, the difference in the proportion of workers in high exposure and low complementarity occupations, conditional on their education level, is less than 10 percentage points \u2014 ranging from 26 percent among workers with middle school education or below to 36 percent among workers with a college education or higher. Conversely, the discrepancy in the potential to benefit from AI is considerably larger. Only 17 percent of workers with middle school education or below find themselves in high-exposure and high-complementarity occupations, as opposed to over 50 percent of workers with a college education or higher.  \nWith respect to age, the research does not observe a straightforward association between age and AI exposure. Overall, age patterns are likely very intertwined with country-specific long-term trends in educational attainment and female labor force participation, which can substantially blur the underlying life-cycle profiles. One general observation is that the youngest workers tend to have lower AI labor market exposure than prime-age workers. Moreover, conditional on being in high-exposure occupations, younger workers are also less likely to be in jobs with high complementarity, and thus are more susceptible to potential negative impacts stemming from widespread AI adoption in labor markets.  \nWith respect to earnings, the research indicates a positive association between earnings and share of employment (affected by AI adoption in labor markets) in high-exposure occupations emerges in all countries. Our analysis reveals a more equal distribution of workers with high AI labor market exposure and low complementarity across the income distribution, indicating that the risks from widespread AI adoption in labor markets may be broadly evenly distributed across the earnings distribution. In contrast, upon assessing which workers stand to benefit most, in all countries in the sample, employment in high-complementarity occupations is concentrated in the top deciles of the earnings distribution.On a scale of 0-10, how concerned are you about the safety of the AI products you currently use or have used in the past?

Given the high degree of uncertainty over the future of this fast-pacing and broadly applicable technology, the concept of exposure is purposely framed as agnostic on the likelihood of AI complementing or replacing labor in the performance of a given task or occupation.  \nWith respect to occupations, the research indicates that a large share of professional and managerial occupations are almost entirely in the high-exposure categories, corroborating the UK's high aggregate exposure, followed by the US. Nearly 30 percent of workers in the UK are employed in professional occupations, while the corresponding figure for the US stands just above 15 percent. Although the US hosts a larger share of managers, an occupation that exhibits the highest degree of complementarity, the difference between the US (14.4 percent) and UK (10.7 percent) remains relatively small. These occupational groups are also marked by high complementarity.  \nWith respect to gender differences, the research suggests women face a higher labor market exposure to AI compared to men. For instance, in the US, 68 percent of women are in high exposure occupations compared to 51 percent of men. This outcome is primarily attributable to the occupational distribution across genders. Female employment is more concentrated in service and retail occupations, which are relatively more exposed to AI, while men are more likely to be in occupations intensive in manual labor, which are less exposed. Despite women's higher labor market exposure to AI, focusing our attention to the potential for complementarity suggests that women may have a higher likelihood of benefiting from the proliferation of AI. Conversely, although men generally exhibit a larger share of managerial jobs, which have the highest degree of complementarity, the total shares of managers compared to professionals is relatively small.
