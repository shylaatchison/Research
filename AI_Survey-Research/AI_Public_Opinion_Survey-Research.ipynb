    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the results of recent research in artifical intelligence (AI) and economics (see *Aher et al. 2023*, *Argyle et al. 2023*, *Horton 2023*, *Kim et al. 2023*, and *Korinek et al. 2023*), a novel form of sequence-to-sequence text generation transformer models known as Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be reliable tools for generating synthetic survey data. That is, LLMs have been shown to reliably and accurately generate simulated economics agents for generating synthetic survey data that approximates real-world outcomes. In this study, I use OpenAI's API to interact with the gpt-4-1106-preview model (i.e., the GPT-4 model) to generate simulated economic agents that act as survey participants by generating synthetic survey data based upon the varying socio-demographic traits attributed to each simulated agent. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to generate a diverse set of responses that would mimic the responses of real-world survery participants with different socio-demographic traits for a public opinion survey on artifical intelligence. The simulated agents' socio-demographhic traits include age, gender, educational attainment, occupation, income, nationality and political party preference (for those agents of U.S. nationality), political views, economic views, openness to new information and belief-updating, trust in scientific research, and beliefs about artifical intelligence. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the survey is designed to test for belief-updating by generating survey responses for a selection of relevant survey questions pre- and post-exposure to an information shock from including key passages from a recent IMF working paper on AI labor market exposure (see *IMF Working Paper, 2023*). The purpose of adding this aspect to the survey is to attempt to measure the effect on AI public opinion due to concern over AI's impact on future job security. <br>\n",

    "## Literature Review\n",
    "Recent scholarly discourse has witnessed an expanding exploration into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the domains of social sciences, economics, and labor market research. This literature review synthesizes key findings and thematic developments from a range of recent academic contributions, highlighting the multifaceted roles and potential implications of LLMs in these fields. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent research on Large Language Models in social science research have shown the potential of LLMs for applications in simulating human samples and in producing AI-augmented surveys. In Aher, Arriaga, and Kalai introduce Turing Experiments (TE) as a novel approach to evaluate LLMs' effectiveness in simulating human behavior samples in experimental settings. Their findings affirm that LLMs can accurately replicate classic human subject study outcomes, albeit with a cautionary note on the \"hyper-accuracy distortion\" observed in some models, potentially impacting fields like education and arts (*Aher et al., 2023*). Argyle et al. explore the feasibility of employing LLMs as stand-ins for specific human sub-populations in social science investigations. They discuss the concept of algorithmic fidelity and demonstrate that, with appropriate conditioning, models like GPT-3 can accurately replicate responses from varied demographic segments. However, they caution against potential misuses of this technology (*Argyle et al., 2023*). Kim and Lee's research on AI-augenmented surveys in the social sciences advances the integration of LLMs into social surveys for enhanced opinion prediction. They investigate fine-tuning LLMs to align with specific survey contexts and demographics, uncovering substantial potential in bridging data gaps and monitoring shifts in public opinion. However, they also recognize the inherent limitations of LLMs in completely substituting human responses (*Kim et al., 2023*). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, recent research suggests Large Language Models can be applied to advance economic research. Korinek's exploration into LLMs' applications in economic research underscores their utility in diverse areas such as ideation, writing, and data analysis. He envisions LLMs as potent tools to boost researcher productivity, and speculates on the broader impacts of cognitive automation in the field of economics (*Korinek, 2023*). Horton's pioneering study on LLMs as simulated economic agents delves into the utility of LLMs, particularly GPT-3, as 'homo silicus' in economic experiments. He asserts that these models effectively mimic human economic behaviors, providing an efficient and ethically sound alternative for experimental economics. Horton’s work underlines the capability of LLMs to replicate human experiment results, offering transformative prospects for economic research methodologies (*Horton, 2023*). Futhermore, the IMF Working Paper offers a critical examination of AI's influence on labor markets, noting the differential exposure across countries and demographic groups. This paper posits that AI technologies, including LLMs, could simultaneously disrupt and enhance labor markets, stressing the necessity of policy frameworks to manage AI integration and mitigate employment displacement risks (*IMF Working Paper, 2023*). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Collectively, these studies underscore the emerging significance of LLMs in social science and economic research. They highlight the benefits of LLMs in terms of efficiency, scalability, and ethical considerations, alongside challenges pertaining to representativeness, privacy, and ethical complexities. The literature calls for continued examination of LLMs’ capabilities and constraints, and the formulation of ethical guidelines for their application in research and policy formulation. <br>\n",

    "Li, Carlo Pizzinelli, Augustus J. Panton, Marina Mendes Tavares, Mauro Cazzaniga, Longji. *“Labor Market Exposure to AI: Cross-Country Differences and Distributional Implications.”* IMF. Accessed January 24, 2024. <https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/04/Labor-Market-Exposure-to-AI-Cross-country-Differences-and-Distributional-Implications-539656>. <br>\n",

    "In the latest research on Labor Market Exposure to Artificial Intelligence (AI) conducted by the International Monterey Fund (IMF), 'complementarity' is defined as a measure of AI’s potential as either a complement or a substitute for labor, where complementarity reflects lower risks of job displacement, and 'exposure' is defined to reflect the potential for AI to be integrated into each occupation based the tasks and skills that characterize each job. Given the high degree of uncertainty over the future of this fast-pacing and broadly applicable technology, the concept of exposure is purposely framed as agnostic on the likelihood of AI complementing or replacing labor in the performance of a given task or occupation. According to the research, women and highly educated workers face greater occupational exposure to AI, at both high and low complementarity. Additionally, workers in the upper tail of the earnings distribution are more likely to be in occupations with high exposure but also high potential complementarity. <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "With respect to occupations, the research indicates that a large share of professional and managerial occupations are almost entirely in the high-exposure categories, corroborating the UK’s high aggregate exposure, followed by the US. Nearly 30 percent of workers in the UK are employed in professional occupations, while the corresponding figure for the US stands just above 15 percent. Although the US hosts a larger share of managers, an occupation that exhibits the highest degree of complementarity, the difference between the US (14.4 percent) and UK (10.7 percent) remains relatively small. These occupational groups are also marked by high complementarity. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to gender differences, the research suggests women face a higher labor market exposure to AI compared to men. For instance, in the US, 68 percent of women are in high exposure occupations compared to 51 percent of men. This outcome is primarily attributable to the occupational distribution across genders. Female employment is more concentrated in service and retail occupations, which are relatively more exposed to AI, while men are more likely to be in occupations intensive in manual labor, which are less exposed. Despite women's higher labor market exposure to AI, focusing our attention to the potential for complementarity suggests that women may have a higher likelihood of benefiting from the proliferation of AI. Conversely, although men generally exhibit a larger share of managerial jobs, which have the highest degree of complementarity, the total shares of managers compared to professionals is relatively small. Nevertheless, women are also more susceptible to potential negative impacts from AI adoption, particularly in the UK, US, Brazil, and South Africa. This vulnerability arises from their greater representation in clerical jobs, a category characterized by high exposure and low complementarity, thus at higher risk from AI adoption. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to education level, the research indicates workers with college-level degrees are more exposed to AI in the labor market than those with lower educational attainment. Approximately 90 percent of college-educated workers across most countries are in occupations with high AI labor market exposure, primarily in professional roles. In contrast, those without a high school diploma are predominantly involved in elementary occupations, which results in a significantly reduced AI labor market exposure. In most countries, less than 20 percent of these workers find themselves in high-exposure occupations. The only exception is the the UK, where 40 percent of workers with only a middle school education or less are in high-exposure occupations. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering the potential for complementarity, we observe that in all countries within our sample, workers holding a college degree or higher are predominantly concentrated within occupations that exhibit greater potential to benefit from the widespread adoption of AI. In contrast, among those with an education level of middle school or below, workers in exposed occupations display the lowest prospects of benefiting from AI adoption. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the research analysis suggests that the potential adverse impacts of AI might be distributed more evenly than the potential gains. For instance, in the UK, the difference in the proportion of workers in high exposure and low complementarity occupations, conditional on their education level, is less than 10 percentage points — ranging from 26 percent among workers with middle school education or below to 36 percent among workers with a college education or higher. Conversely, the discrepancy in the potential to benefit from AI is considerably larger. Only 17 percent of workers with middle school education or below find themselves in high-exposure and high-complementarity occupations, as opposed to over 50 percent of workers with a college education or higher. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to age, the research does not observe a straightforward association between age and AI exposure. Overall, age patterns are likely very intertwined with country-specific long-term trends in educational attainment and female labor force participation, which can substantially blur the underlying life-cycle profiles. One general observation is that the youngest workers tend to have lower AI labor market exposure than prime-age workers. Moreover, conditional on being in high-exposure occupations, younger workers are also less likely to be in jobs with high complementarity, and thus are more susceptible to potential negative impacts stemming from widespread AI adoption in labor markets. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to earnings, the research indicates a positive association between earnings and share of employment (affected by AI adoption in labor markets) in high-exposure occupations emerges in all countries. Our analysis reveals a more equal distribution of workers with high AI labor market exposure and low complementarity across the income distribution, indicating that the risks from widespread AI adoption in labor markets may be broadly evenly distributed across the earnings distribution. In contrast, upon assessing which workers stand to benefit most, in all countries in the sample, employment in high-complementarity occupations is concentrated in the top deciles of the earnings distribution. <br>\n",
