    "\n",

    "* Alternatively, end a line with two or more spaces (referred to as \"trailing whitespace\"). **NOT RECOMMENDED**: Trailing whitespace is difficult to see in an editor.\n",

    "\n",
    "Add emphasis by making text **bold** or *italic*.\n",

    "##### Bold:\n",
    "\n",
    "To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters. <br>\n",

    "##### Bold and Italic:\n",
    "\n",
    "To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters. <br>\n",

    "#### Blockquotes\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Blockquote Best Practices**: For compatibility, put blank lines before and after blockquotes. <br>\n",
